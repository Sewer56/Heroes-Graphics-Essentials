         *  Reloaded Mod Loader DLL Modification Template
         *  Sewer56, 2018 ©
         *
         *  -------------------------------------------------------------------------------
         *
         *  Here starts your own mod loader DLL code.
         *
         *  The Init function below is ran at the initialization stage of the game.
         *
         *  The game at this point suspended and frozen in memory. There is no execution
         *  of game code currently ongoing.
         *
         *  This is where you do your hot-patches such as graphics stuff, patching the
         *  window style of the game to borderless, setting up your initial variables, etc.
         *
         *  -------------------------------------------------------------------------------
         *
         *  Important Note:
         *
         *  This function is executed once during startup and SHOULD return as the
         *  mod loader awaits successful completion of the main function.
         *
         *  If you want your mod/code to sit running in the background, please initialize
         *  another thread and run your code in the background on that thread, otherwise
         *  please remember to return from the function.
         *
         *  There is also some extra code, including DLL stubs for Reloaded, classes
         *  to interact with the Mod Loader Server as well as other various loader related
         *  utilities available.
         *
         *  -------------------------------------------------------------------------------
         *  Extra Tip:
         *
         *  For Reloaded mod development, there are also additional libraries and packages
         *  available on NuGet which provide you with extra functionality.
         *
         *  Examples include:
         *  [Input] Reading controller information using Reloaded's input stack.
         *  [IO] Accessing the individual Reloaded config files.
         *  [Overlays] Easy to use D3D and external overlay code.
         *
         *  Simply search libReloaded on NuGet to find those extras and refer to
         *  Reloaded-Mod-Samples subdirectory on Github for examples of using them (and
         *  sample mods showing how Reloaded can be used).
         *
         *  -------------------------------------------------------------------------------
         *
         *  [Template] Brief Walkthrough:
         *
         *  > ReloadedTemplate/Initializer.cs
         *      Stores Reloaded Mod Loader DLL Template/Initialization Code.
         *      You are not required/should not (need) to modify any of the code.
         *
         *  > ReloadedTemplate/Client.cs
         *      Contains various pieces of code to interact with the mod loader server.
         *
         *      For convenience it's recommended you import Client static(ally) into your
         *      classes by doing it as such `Reloaded_Mod_Template.Reloaded_Code.Client`.
         *
         *      This will avoid you typing the full class name and let you simply type
         *      e.g. Print("SomeTextToConsole").
         *
         *  -------------------------------------------------------------------------------
         *
         *  If you like Reloaded, please consider giving a helping hand. This has been
         *  my sole project taking up most of my free time for months. Being the programmer,
         *  artist, tester, quality assurance, alongside various other roles is pretty hard
         *  and time consuming, not to mention that I am doing all of this for free.
         *
         *  Well, alas, see you when Reloaded releases.
         *
         *  Please keep this notice here for future contributors or interested parties.
         *  If it bothers you, consider wrapping it in a #region.
